## Release notes

The current release (v0.1.0) is a selection of Swedish novels, originally published between 1840 and 1920. The novels were selected from the existing e-texts produced by The Swedish Literature Bank (Litteraturbanken.se); the coding was adapted to the needs of ELTeC-project. Currently, the ELTeC-swe collection contains 58 novels encoded at level 1.

The books were earlier published as e-texts at The Swedish Literature Bank. The scanning was performed at different libraries in Sweden (Royal Library in Stockholm, and University Libraries in Gothenburg, Lund & Uppsala). The work of producing the e-texts in The Swedish Literature Bank was a collective effort of Cai Alfredson and other editors at The Swedish Literature Bank, The Swedish Society for Belles-Lettres, The Collected Works of August Strindberg and The Society of Swedish Literature in Finland.
